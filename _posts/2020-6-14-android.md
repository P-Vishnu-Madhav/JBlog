You can download the apk file from [here](https://github.com/P-Vishnu-Madhav/Writeups_files/blob/master/Android_App_Writeup_files/Sharif_CTF.apk).The file asks for a key as input and prints "Just keep trying :)" if it is  wrong , we can run the application with [ARC Welder](https://arc-welder.en.softonic.com/) which is used to run apk files.The decompilation can be found [here](https://github.com/P-Vishnu-Madhav/Writeups_files/tree/master/Android_App_Writeup_files/Android_App_Writeup_Decompilation/Sharif_CTF_source_from_JADX) then we can use [dex2jar](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dex2jar/) to convert classes.dex to jar file and then we need to get Java source code from jar file where [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) can be used.And looking into isCorrect function we can find the file is loaded with the shared object "adnjni".

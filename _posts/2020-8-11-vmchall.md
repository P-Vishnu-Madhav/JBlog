This was an intresting challenge which I solved recently.I had a lot of fun while solving the challenge. The challenge basically involved little bruteforce and basic python skills , You can download the challenge file from  [here](https://github.com/P-Vishnu-Madhav/Writeups_files/blob/master/practice2). So when we run the binary it asks for command line argument as flag **[hell86 crackme] Please pass the flag as a command-line argument** and prints **ok** if the flag is correct else it prints **wrong**. So when we start debugging in GDB we find the operation system sends a signal trap to kernal and there by the OS executes sigaction.We can see that the whole program is in the form of switch cases.  So when we continue debugging the program we find that the length of the flag is 36 in switch case 36 and later if our input length  is 36 it loads all the input characters at some memory address and starts operations on it.
And furhter debugging the binary we find that the first 5 characters of the input are ```FLAG{```.

```py
if len(inp)!=36:
    print("Give me length of 36")
else:
    somethingelse()
```    
And if the first 5 characters are correct it checks for the last  character **}** and if it true it checks for inside 29 characters with the string ```abdfgehikmanoqrstucvwlxyz-01h23p456u78j9-_.+``` which compares with our flag in the form of mapping indexes at a particular position . Then further debugging the program the fifth character is stored in such a way that the 16th character of the reference string(**abdfgehikmanoqrstucvwlxyz-01h23p456u78j9-_.+**) is our 5th flag character.
So the fifth  character is **x** in  our flag after FLAG{, if it is correct then we go to next character check of the program. It checks in such a way that our previous character will be subtracted with the present character i.e **array[i+1]-array[i]** and then the result is xored with the length starting from 29 and decrements accordingly with the each check. Later the xored result is multiplied thrice with itself. And after all these operations our values will be compared with constant data.

It might be quite difficult to understand what exactly the switch case is doing in IDA or Ghidra so we dynamically debug and understand what exactly the executable is doing :)

I will be breaking else part into parts of program and combine the final result together.
```py
else:
    str_cmp="abdfgehikmanoqrstucvwlxyz-01h23p456u78j9-_.+"
```
## Overview so far
1) The  length of the input which should be given is 36
2) The first 5 characters are **FLAG{** and the last character is **}** 
3) Then our remaining 29 characters are subtracted with the **array[i+1]-array[i]** and goes in a loop where the araay is our remaining characters(29 characters)
4) And the subtracted result is xored with 0x1d and decreases with each check
5) And then it multiplies trice with the xored result 
6) The multiplied result will be checked with some constant data.

## Trick to Reverse the program
So we will start extracting the values from constant data which is compared . We will write a small bruteforce script to extract all the values from the constant data

```py
else:
    str_cmp="abdfgehikmanoqrstucvwlxyz-01h23p456u78j9-_.+"
    array=[5832, -29791, -8000, 13824, -6859, 5832, -29791,24389, -10648, -8, 24389, -13824,
    -17576, 2744,-17576, 19683, -32768, 729, 19683, -1, 729, 1000, 125,-5832, 512, 512, -6859, 8000, -8000]
```
Here is the constant data which is being compared. The trick is to write a simple bruteforce from some range,lets suppose from -100 to lenght of str_cmp as there are some negative values in array and extract values from it and append it to a list.

```py
for i in range(len(array)):
        for j in range(-100,len(str_cmp)):
            if array[i]==j*j*j:     #Reverse from last and get the array values which is multiplied
                l.append(j)
                
```   

Now the second part we do is to xor with the appended values in l and decrement the length accordingly starting from 0x1d and append it to an other list. 

And the final step we do is extract these values from the **str_cmp** string. By the below small trick
```py
ans.append("x")                           #The first character is 0x16 character of the string str_cmp
    count=0
    for t in sol:
        rt=str_cmp.index(ans[count])
        sq=str_cmp[rt+t]
        ans.append(sq)   #Compare the values between the str_cmp string and get the actual string
        count=count+1
```
And finally we convert it to a string and get the flag 
```py
flag="FLAG{"
    for i in range(len(ans)):
        flag+=ans[i]                   
    print(flag+"}")  
```    
Our final script looks like 
```py
inp=input("Give me ur input : ")
l=[]
sol=[]
ans=[]
if(len(inp)!=36):     #Constraint in switch case 36
    print("Give me exactly 36 length")
else:
    str_cmp="abdfgehikmanoqrstucvwlxyz-01h23p456u78j9-_.+"
    array=[5832, -29791, -8000, 13824, -6859, 5832, -29791,24389, -10648, -8, 24389, -13824, -17576, 
    2744,-17576, 19683, -32768, 729, 19683, -1, 729, 1000, 125, -5832, 512, 512, -6859, 8000, -8000]   #Data which was compared in end
    for i in range(len(array)):
        for j in range(-100,len(str_cmp)):
            if array[i]==j*j*j:     #Reverse from last and get the array values which is multiplied
                l.append(j) 
                print(l,end='')         
    t=0x1d
    for i in l:
        m=i^t           
        t=t-1
        sol.append(m)                          #And xor it the values starting from 0x1d and start decrementing value
    ans.append("x")                            #The first character is 0x16 character of the string str_cmp
    count=0
    for t in sol:
        rt=str_cmp.index(ans[count])
        sq=str_cmp[rt+t]
        ans.append(sq)                     #Compare the values between the str_cmp string and get the actual string
        count=count+1    

    flag="FLAG{"
    for i in range(len(ans)):
        flag+=ans[i]                   
    print(flag+"}")  
```    
    
## Flag: FLAG{x86-1s-s0-fund4m3nt4lly-br0k3n}

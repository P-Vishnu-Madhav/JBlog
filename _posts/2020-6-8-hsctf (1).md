The source is provided along with the post ,so by looking into the source code we can first find that the length of the flag is 12 and then there is a  string that is being modified and it must be equal to "I$N]=6YiVwC" after the transformation .And looking into the flag transformed function we can find out that each input character is taken in a loop and then passed into picknum function where there is a recursive call repeated untill the ord of number becomes odd so,understanding this I printed all the odd character values and after this the numbers are stored in a temp array starting from the ending character.
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class AscII {
	static int num = 0;
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		 Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		 System.out.print("Enter your  guess: ");
		 String guess = sc.nextLine();
		 
		 if (guess.length()!= 12) 
			 System.out.println("Sorry, thats wrong.");
		 else {
			 if(flagTransformed(guess).equals("I$N]=6YiVwC")) 
				 System.out.println("Yup the flag is flag{" + guess + "}");			 
			 else 
				 System.out.println("nope"); 
		 }
	}
	
	public static String flagTransformed(String guess) {
		char[] transformed = new char[12];
		
		for(int i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
			num = 1;
			transformed[i] = (char)(((int)guess.charAt(i) + pickNum(i + 1)) % 127);	
		}
		
		char[] temp = new char[12];		
		for(int i = 11; i >= 0; i--) 
			temp[11-i] = transformed[i];
			
		return new String(temp);	
	}
	
	private static int pickNum(int i) {
		
		for(int x = 0; x <= i; x++)
			num+=x;
		
		if(num % 2 == 0)
		{   System.out.println(num);
		    System.out.println("--------");		
         	return num;
		}
		else 
			num = pickNum(num);
			System.out.println(num);
		
		return num;		
	}	 
}
```
The source looks so simple and the odd num we get are
```
pick = [2, 4, 222110, 3080, 16, 22, 464, 740, 46, 56, 2753030, 1582628994]
```
And the pytho equivalent for this is below
```py
a="I$N]=6YiVwC"
pick = [2, 4, 222110, 3080, 16, 22, 464, 740, 46, 56, 2753030, 1582628994]
flag="flag{"
for i in range(12):
    for j in range(127):
        if ((j+pick[i])%127) == ord(a[11-i]):
            flag=flag+chr(j)
            break
print(flag+"}")
```
```
Flag: flag{AscII is key}
```

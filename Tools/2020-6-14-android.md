You can download the apk file from [here](https://github.com/P-Vishnu-Madhav/Writeups_files/blob/master/Android_App_Writeup_files/Sharif_CTF.apk).The file asks for a key as input and prints "Just keep trying :)" if it is  wrong and prints the flag if it is correct.I used [Android Apk decompiler](http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk) for decompilation of apk file and the source code looks like  [this](https://github.com/P-Vishnu-Madhav/Writeups_files/tree/master/Android_App_Writeup_files/Android_App_Writeup_Decompilation/Sharif_CTF_source_from_JADX) from the decompilation I found a dex file(compiled code written for android) where that executable need to analyzed then I used  [dex2jar](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dex2jar/) to convert that dex file  to jar file so that we can get Java source code. From jar file we can get java source code with  [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) .And analyzing the java source code there are 2 functions isCorrect and onClick  where there is a shared object file adnjni which is being used by onClick function.

And in the onClick function there is check where isCorrect function return value must be 1 . So mainly we need to analyze [adnjni.so](https://github.com/P-Vishnu-Madhav/Writeups_files/blob/master/Android_App_Writeup_files/Android_App_Writeup_Decompilation/Sharif_CTF_source_from_JADX/resources/lib/armeabi/libadnjni.so) file where we got from the decompilation.

![onClick](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/P-Vishnu-Madhav/P-Vishnu-Madhav.github.io/master/assets/img/onClick.png)

Then analyzing  [adnjni.so](https://github.com/P-Vishnu-Madhav/Writeups_files/blob/master/Android_App_Writeup_files/Android_App_Writeup_Decompilation/Sharif_CTF_source_from_JADX/resources/lib/armeabi/libadnjni.so) file using ghidra there are many characters which are just compared and if they are correct then flag is printed.
![ghidra analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/P-Vishnu-Madhav/P-Vishnu-Madhav.github.io/master/assets/img/strcmp.png)
We just need to find the character of each hex value and we get the flag.

## Flag: Sharif_CTF(833489ef285e6fa80690099efc5d9c9d)
This maybe a very basic reversing challenge but we started getting familiar with the android tools and android reversing challenges,Hope you all enjoyed this writeup.
